## Changelog

- Added GWEN/Label to support a commonly used widget.

## Known differences

There are several differences between the CEGUI and GWEN skin due to the differences between
these two systems. Some differences/issues are listed below:

 - Combo Edit Box/EditBox
    - Caret Color in Text Boxes made pink because CEGUI won't make it blink
    - Selected Text Box state not ported
    - Read Only edit boxes have pink outline. This is usually used for hover part in GWEN.
 - Combo Edit Box
    - Menu Box seems to leave white faded border on left
    - Didn't use shadow on drop down
 - Group Box
    - Groupbox in CEGUI only supports images for the borders. Therefore I've displayed the
      label at the top. Alternatively could display white or another color behind the text
    - ComboDropLists and Listboxes uses GWEN disabled color
 - Image Button
    - Set the disabled image button to be displayed as normal because otherwise it is not
      shown
 - Listbox
    - Items don't have odd and even coloring or correct highlighting on mouse over
 - Menu
    - No shadow around popup
    - Forced padding on Menu Items as Font Horizontal Extend was too short
 - Multicolumn List
    - Whitespace appears on the far right of the list headers
    - Should add mouse cursor when resizing columns
 - Progress Bar
    - Can only support 1px wide border for progress bar
    - Disabled Progress bar is not supported in GWEN. Therefore adopted greyed out approach.
 - Tab Control
    - Couldn't replicate GWEN tab system exactly.
